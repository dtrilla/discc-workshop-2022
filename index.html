                    Recent papers from Meta (Facebook) and Google [1-3] have created a major concern about data integrity in large-scale computing in cloud data centers. The term “mercurial cores” has been coined [2] to refer to errant processor cores that have been clearly diagnosed as being the source of generating silent data errors – and recent panels (as referred to above) have brought together experts from cloud service providers and processor chip designers with the objective of raising awareness of this acute problem, and also encouraging leading edge research to devise affordable chip and system-level mitigation solutions. In addition to such data integrity concerns, the rise of data security and privacy breaches in cloud computing environments has accelerated research and development of practical solutions that enable computing with encrypted data (e.g., advanced cryptographic methods like Fully Homomorphic Computing or FHE); e.g., recent papers [4-6].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This workshop (DISCC-2022) proposes to bring together aspects of data integrity and security in a single, unified forum. The workshop will comprise a keynote speech, several contributed papers and, time permitting, a closing panel session involving leading edge experts in data integrity and security in a hyper-scale cloud computing setting. Potential speakers are encouraged to submit an extended abstract (1-2 pages) highlighting the key contributions in the light of the above-stated technical scope of the problem. Solution approaches at the algorithm, software/firmware and/or hardware level are encouraged for early dissemination and discussion in a workshop setting. 
                    <p>

Mayflower has no captain and no crew, and is a scientific research vessel for gathering data from the ocean to help us understand the impact of climate change and pollution, studying things like microplastics and the health of marine mammals. This fully autonomous boat is scheduled to sail from Plymouth UK to Plymouth Massachusetts, recreating the journey of the Pilgrim Fathers just over 400 years ago. Andy will describe how the AI Captain navigates the ship and talks about some of the scientific experiments on board, and the data these are producing.">

Attackers have seized the advantage with the democratization of AI and the ubiquitous availability of computing resources via third party service providers while defenders endeavor to keep pace. The recent Presidential Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity from the current US administration significantly raises the bar on security on both government and commercial IT service providers creating a unique opportunity to infuse new security architectures and technologies into enterprise defenses. The time is ripe for harvesting decades long work in systems security research to implement and deploy confidential computing mechanisms to lay the foundation for zero trust architectures and secure enterprise and cloud environments. In this talk, we will describe the drivers and evolution of both compute-centric and data-centric confidential computing mechansims that were pioneered at IBM Research and discuss the important problems that remain to be solved to realize the promise of these technologies and bring change across the industry.">

The main area where the current computing paradigm and architecture have lagged is data movement. The transfer of data from where it is stored, the off-chip memory, to where it is analyzed, the processor, takes one order of magnitude more time and consumes two orders of magnitude higher energy than the actual computation (e.g., a single-precision addition). Adding processing units as close as possible to the memory cells, i.e., processing in memory (PIM), alleviates the data movement overhead, unlocking the value of modern applications. However, realizing the true potential of PIM requires rethinking and simplifying the control, access, and communication mechanisms of PIM units. In my talk, I first discuss the inefficacy of traditional MIMD, SIMD, and SIMT architectures for data-intensive applications, with few computations per data element and challenges due to control and access divergence. Then, I introduce our proposed architectures, Fulcrum and FulcrumV2 (Gearbox), that offer a trade-off between (i) full control and access divergence support in MIMD and (ii) no/costly control or divergence support in SIMD/SIMT approaches. We show the flexibility of our design by mapping important kernels from different domains such as machine learning, database management, and graph processing. Finally, I conclude with our vision for identifying common requirements of data-intensive applications, designing a semi-general-purpose PIM-based accelerator (which supports a wide range of applications), and developing a software stack for our accelerator."> Rethinking Control, Access, and Communication Mechanisms for Data-intensive Applications <br> Marzieh Lenjani ( University of Virginia ) </td>

This success has been enabled by advancements in the design of hardware platforms such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and accelerators. However, recent trends in state-of-the-art DNNs point to enormous and ever-increasing compute requirements, surpassing the rate of advancements in deep learning hardware. This growing gap between the compute demands and hardware capabilities threatens to stymie progress in the field of machine learning. Creating the next generation of efficient and robust machine learning systems will require hardware-aware design, or consideration of hardware characteristics in the design of the algorithms. My talk broadly characterizes our efforts into two directions, i.e., improving execution efficiency and robustness of  machine learning systems. As part of the first direction of efforts, I will be discussing techniques to improve the training complexity of DNNs through hardware awareness. We first consider the widely-used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm used for training DNNs. We propose a method to use localized learning, which is computationally cheaper and incurs lower memory footprint, to accelerate an SGD-based training framework with minimal impact on accuracy. This is achieved by employing localized learning in a spatio-temporally selective manner, i.e., in selected network layers and epochs. Next, we consider input interpolation techniques to reduce the effective size of the training dataset every epoch. Specifically, groups of training inputs are combined such that training on the resulting composite sample, has a similar effect on model performance as training on the individual inputs. To preserve accuracy, we propose techniques to mitigate the interference between the features of the constituent inputs in the composite sample. Further, we devise selective interpolation strategies, i.e., only a subset of training inputs are interpolated every epoch. For the second direction of our efforts on robustness, I will be discussing a new challenge identified in the field of adversarial attacks, by proposing attacks that degrade the execution efficiency (energy or time) of a DNN on a given hardware platform. As a specific embodiment of such attacks, we propose sparsity attacks, which perturb the inputs to a DNN so as to result in much lower sparsity within the network, causing it’s latency and energy to be increased on sparsity-optimized hardware platforms. In summary, this talk will demonstrate that hardware-awareness can result in improved performance of deep learning, while also opening up new classes of attacks that must be addressed."> Hardware-Aware Efficient and Robust Deep Learning <br> Sarada Krithivasan ( Purdue Univers

The time is ripe for harvesting decades long work in systems security research to implement and deploy confidential computing mechanisms to lay the foundation for zero trust architectures and secure enterprise and cloud environments.

The remarkable algorithmic performance of DNNs comes with extremely high computation and storage demands, which outpace the growth in capabilities of commodity hardware. In this talk, I will present our two recent efforts to address this challenge – (i) Approximate computation method to design efficient precision-reconfigurable hardware and (ii) In-Memory computation framework enabled by compact and energy-efficient Piezoelectric FETs (PeFETs). Precision scaling is a popular technique to minimize both the compute and storage requirements of DNNs. Efforts toward creating ultra-low-precision (sub-8-bit) DNNs for efficient inference suggest that the minimum precision required to achieve a given network-level accuracy varies considerably across and within networks, requiring support for variable precision in DNN hardware. Previous proposals such as bit-serial hardware incur high overheads, significantly diminishing the benefits of lower precision. To efficiently support precision re-configurability in DNN accelerators, we introduce an approximate computing method wherein multiply-accumulate computations are performed at the granularity of blocks (a block is a group of bits). We propose approximations to block-wise computation in order to enable precision reconfigurability with low overheads. We show that our framework can achieve significant improvements in system energy and performance with small loss in classification accuracy. The performance and energy-efficiency of data-intensive applications like DNN inference in traditional Von-Neumann architectures are bottlenecked by the slow and energy-intensive data movements between memory and processing unit. In-memory computing is a promising approach that alleviates this bottleneck by computing within memory. Non-volatile memory (NVM) based in-memory computing has gained considerable interest recently due to the desirable characteristics of NVMs such as high density and low-leakage power. Most of the previously proposed NVMs have a major disadvantage – slow and power-hungry current-driven write. Recently, Piezoelectric FETs (PeFETs) have shown considerable potential for efficient future memory hierarchies due to their fast and low-power electric-field driven write. We enhance the PeFET memory cell with ternary compute capability to perform efficient in-memory computation. We demonstrate the benefits of the ternary compute-enabled PeFET cell by performing ternary DNN inference and achieving significant system improvements compared to a well-optimized near-memory SRAM baseline."> Precision Reconfigurable and In-Memory Computing Architectures for Efficient DNN Inference <br> Reena Elangovan ( Purdue University ) </td>

The increasing need for analyzing billion-scale data  calls for faster and more scalable algorithms for these problems. There are certain trade-offs between the quality and speed of such clustering algorithms. In this paper, we design scalable algorithms that achieve high quality when evaluated based on ground truth. We develop a generalized sequential and shared-memory parallel framework based on the LambdaCC objective (introduced by Veldt et al.), which encompasses modularity and correlation clustering. Our framework consists of highly-optimized implementations that scale to large data sets of billions of edges and that obtain high-quality clusters compared to ground-truth data, on both unweighted and weighted graphs. Our empirical evaluation shows that this framework improves the state-of-the-art trade-offs between speed and quality of scalable community detection. For example, on a 30-core machine with two-way hyper-threading, our implementations achieve orders of magnitude speedups over other correlation clustering baselines, and up to 28.44x speedups over our own sequential baselines while maintaining or improving quality.

Unfortunately, the reduced data durability guarantees provided can cause data loss or slow data recovery. In this environment, non-volatile memory (NVM) offers the ability to attain both high performance and data durability in distributed applications. However, it is unclear how to tie NVM memory persistency models to the existing data consistency frameworks, and what are the durability guarantees that the combination will offer to distributed applications. In this presentation, I’ll talk about the concept of Distributed Data Persistency (DDP) model, which is the binding of the memory persistency model with the data consistency model in a distributed system. I reason about the interaction between consistency and persistency by using the concepts of Visibility Point and Durability Point. I present the design of low-latency distributed protocols for DDP models that combine five consistency models with five persistency models. For the resulting DDP models, I’ll show the trade-offs between performance, durability, and intuition provided to the programmer."> Distributed Data Persistency <br> Apostolos Kokolis ( University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ) </td>

UGF achieves portability with reasonable effort by decoupling the architecture-independent algorithm from the architecture-specific backend and schedules. We introduce a new domain-specific intermediate representation, the GraphIR, that is key to this decoupling.

A programmable interface, or Agent, allows for RF to observe and microarchitecturally intervene at key pipeline stages of the superscalar core. New microarchitectural components, specific to applications, are synthesized on-demand to RF. All instructions still flow through the superscalar pipeline, as usual, but their execution is streamlined (better instructions per cycle (IPC)) through microarchitectural intervention by RF. Our research shows that one can achieve large speedups of individual applications, by analyzing their bottlenecks and providing customized microarchitectural solutions to target these bottlenecks.

The main challenge for designing efficient k-core algorithms is that a single change to the graph can cause the decomposition to change significantly. We present the first parallel batch-dynamic algorithm for maintaining an approximate k-core decomposition that is efficient in both theory and practice. Given an initial graph with m edges, and a batch of B updates, our algorithm provably maintains a (2 + c)-approximation of the coreness values for all vertices (for any constant c > 0) in O(B log^2 m) amortized work and O(log^2 m log log m) depth (parallel time) with high probability. We present the first proof of this approximation factor in the dynamic setting under our depth and work bounds in the batch-dynamic setting. We implemented and experimentally evaluated our algorithm on a 30-core machine with two-way hyper-threading on 11 graphs of varying densities and sizes. Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm achieves up to a 114.52x speedup against the best parallel implementation, up to a 544.22x speedup against the best approximate sequential algorithm, and up to a 723.72x speedup against the best exact sequential algorithm.
